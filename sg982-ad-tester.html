Every time I test the ad in my own browser it works fine, but when looking at the analytics, I'm seeing that all the other ads on my page have WAY bigger impression numbers than the video ads.

They require us to provide a link or APK to a test or live environment where they would see their tag being fired. Problem is that we have no app testing facility.
